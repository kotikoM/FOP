# 🖥️ Fundamentals of Programming – A First-Year Survivor's Guide  

Welcome to **Fundamentals of Programming**, where enthusiasm meets frustration, and logic meets the inexplicable. This repository is a collection of assignments, exercises, and highly questionable coding decisions made in the desperate pursuit of passing an introductory programming course.  

## 📌 What’s Inside?  

💻 **Basic Syntax** – As if I knew anything.  
🔄 **Loops & Conditionals** – One too many `for` loops, never enough.  
💾 **Functions & Scope** – Featuring inline comments, inefficient algorithms, with few exceptions (spotify is peak).  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

This code comes with **no guarantees of efficiency, correctness, or sanity**. Any resemblance to good programming practices is purely coincidental. Use at your own risk.  

## 🛠️ Requirements  

- A computer (preferably one that can withstand repeated hard reboots).  
- A code editor (or sheer willpower to write code in Notepad).  
- A tolerance for inexplicable bugs and existential crises.  

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. **Don’t.**  
2. If you insist, proceed at your own risk:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fundamentals-of-programming.git
   cd fundamentals-of-programming
